<b>On the first day we arrived at the Burg Khalifa complex, the complex includes a mall known as dubai Mall, a huge tower known as burg khalifa, an artificial lake, an ancient covered market and hotels.
<br/>the dubai Mall is a huge mall that covers an area of 1.1 million square meters and has 1,200 stores inside. the mall contains dozens of cafes, restaurants and hundreds of luxury stores. <br/> What's nice to see is that the stores are designed in such an invested way that you don't see it in other places.
burg khalifa - The burg khalifa is the tallest tower in the world with 128 floors, which includes hotels including a hotel by the well-known designer Armani, luxury restaurants and various offices.<br/> during the visit to the tower we went up to the highest floor and were impressed by the gorgeous view that you don't see every day.
<br/>the royal lake - in addition to this, there is an artificial lake in the complex and inside it are the largest singing fountains in the world, when the music starts the fountains move according to the rhythm and it is a wonderful experience, it was very difficult to walk away. <br/> In the lake itself you can go sailing and this is a tremendous experience.
<br/>the ancient market - adjacent to the complex of the burg khalifa there is a market where you can buy a variety of food from many countries of the world.<br/> we stopped at the Turkish restaurant and enjoyed delicious baklava and tea. </b> </p>
